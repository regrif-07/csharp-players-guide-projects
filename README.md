# csharp-players-guide-projects
Solutions to challenges from the book "The C# Player's Guide (5th edition)".

Some solutions may not meet the set conditions a little, but in general, all the tasks have been solved.

Each challenge has its own corresponding project. 
There is also a separate Utility project containing classes used in many projects.

During the development of these solutions, I already had experience programming and working with C#, so some solutions may seem more complicated than originally planned by the author of the book.
